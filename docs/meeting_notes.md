# Meeting notes

## 2019-02-22

Timeline: project finishes end of June.

Things that HIRMEOS like:

- Docker
- microservices
- the OLAP model
- tool should be modular, configurable, updatable

Hosting & authentication/user access control - probably beyond my remit for the initial work, but can think about them and advise.

Keen to avoid inappropriate comparisons by users.

Use the UCL Press dashboards as initial model.

HIRMEOS are on Github, repositories are public.


## 2019-03-19

- Main focus is book-level: "a book over time, various data sources"
- also want to collect multiple books; "best channels" for a book 
- HIRMEOS do their own "altmetrics"
- No API yet but some example data (_e.g._ CSV)

Hosting:

- Ubiquity?
- may use a Docker recipe
- look into GDPR issues


Other things to look into:

- existing Tableau dashboards (UCL Press, need credentials)
- tools to generate mock data from SQL/API schema
